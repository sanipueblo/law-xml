        <num>(b)</num>
        <text>The Pueblo advocates for students, ages 3 through high school, who are enrolled in, or eligible for enrollment in, a federally-recognized tribe and not attending or served by Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) schools, and who are currently being served from respective tribal jurisdiction boundaries and service areas; and,</text>

        <num>(c)</num>
